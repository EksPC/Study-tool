# Study-tool
StudyTool is a Java application designed by a college student to help manage study tasks efficiently. It integrates a focus clock, a todo list, and a calendar linked to the todo list, providing a comprehensive solution for academic organization.

### Features
- Focus Clock: Utilize the focus clock to allocate dedicated time intervals for studying and breaks. This technique promotes productivity and prevents burnout by encouraging regular breaks.
- Todo List: Create and manage tasks seamlessly with the integrated todo list. Keep track of assignments, readings, and other study-related activities in one central location.
- Calendar Integration: Link tasks from the todo list to the calendar for better planning and visualization. Stay organized by scheduling tasks according to deadlines and prioritizing your study schedule effectively.

### Technical description
I tried to improve my programming skills with this project both by following a pattern design, that resulted in a mix of Layer architecture and MVC, and by implementing new technologies and framework that I've never used before like JAXB, JUnit.
